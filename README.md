## Skidnet: Multithreaded Java Mini Internet

### Overview
Skidnet aims to simulate a simplified version of the internet by implementing various layers and protocols. This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of network architecture, communication protocols, and multithreading in Java.

### Features
The Skidnet project encompasses several essential features, including:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Skidnet follows a layered architecture model, inspired by the TCP/IP protocol suite, to simulate different layers of the internet. This includes the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers.

2. **Multithreading**: Skidnet utilizes Java's multithreading capabilities to enable concurrent processing and handling of multiple network connections and requests. This ensures optimal resource utilization and responsiveness.

3. **Protocol Implementations**: Skidnet implements key protocols, such as IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP, within their respective layers. Each protocol is designed and implemented to handle the specific functionalities and requirements associated with that layer.

4. **Packet Routing**: Skidnet incorporates packet routing algorithms, such as routing tables, to enable efficient data transmission and routing within the simulated network.

5. **Socket Programming**: Skidnet employs socket programming techniques to establish and manage network connections, enabling communication between network nodes.

6. **Error Handling and Reliability**: Skidnet includes error handling mechanisms and implements reliability features like error detection, error correction, and flow control to ensure accurate and robust data transmission.

### Technologies
The Skidnet project utilizes the following technologies and concepts:

- **Java**: Skidnet is implemented using the Java programming language, leveraging its multithreading capabilities and networking libraries.

- **Networking Concepts**: The project incorporates various networking concepts, such as network layers, protocols, socket programming, and packet routing algorithms.
